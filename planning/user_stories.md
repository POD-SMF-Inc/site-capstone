## Problem Statement

When a student enters college there are several financial responsibilities that are imposed upon them, such as tuition costs, dorming fees, meal plans, and common lifestyle costs. As these costs increase, the need for budgeting becomes more essential and beneficial. During these moments, college students may prioritize allocating their money towards saving for their tuition costs and textbook fees, rather than purchasing/investing in foods that properly nourish them. Therefore, it has become a common occurrence for students to purchase unhealthy food options for low costs of money.

## User Roles

- College Student: a user who is seeking recipes for a filling meal

## User Personas

- Bob is a 19 year old originally from New Jersey but is going to college in Massachusetts. Alongside his tuition, Bob is responsible for purchasing textbooks for his classes, handling dorming costs and purchasing living necessities. As a computer science major, Bob is constantly using his laptop which also requires him to purchase various software subscriptions. In order to pay his bills, Bob has to budget less money towards his meals, which causes him to consistently purchase fast food and processed meals. Due to his lack of healthy eating habits Bob finds himself to be tired and the victim of several migraines. After a visit to the doctor, Bob is informed that in order for his health to improve he would have to improve his diet. Therefore, Bob is searching for meal options that are both affordable and healthy.

- Maya is a rising sophomore from New York and has had difficulty maintaining her vegan diet ever since she got to Boston College. When she was at home, her mother made her vegan meals but at college she had limited vegan options at the dining center. Unfortunately college students aren’t allowed to skip meal plans their first year, so she struggled with consuming the right amount of calories each day and lost some weight.   Now that she’s able to live in her own apartment off campus, she can buy groceries that satisfy her vegan diet and explore new recipes for vegan meals. It’s important that she maintains a healthy diet to excel in her med classes.
