## Problem Statement

About 60% of binge viewers are bingeing all by themselves, often spending hours at a time being cooped up alone. This data comes from the Arris Group, a US company that manufacturers equipment for cable companies. COVID has worsened this situation by limiting our interactions with others, preventing us from creating long lasting relationships based on common interests. According to a survey conducted by MedicalNewsToday, out of 1,008 people aged 18–35, 80% of participants reported “significant depressive symptoms” during the pandemic. People who described themselves as feeling lonely also reported experiencing anxiety (76%), a loss of feelings of connectedness (58%), and depression (78%). Our application will be dedicated to help ease the sense of loneliness within current social media users that are 18 years older and up.

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

Our project stands out because it’s specific to connect people with similar interests in music and movies. We provide a website for users to interact and meet new people during a time when it’s difficult to put yourself out there in physical spaces.
