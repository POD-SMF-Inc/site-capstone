# Project Proposal

Pod Members: Samara Augustin, Marisleysis De La Cruz, Flor Hernandez Rodriguez

## Problem Statement

When a student enters college there are several financial responsibilities that are imposed upon them, such as tuition costs, dorming fees, meal plans, and common lifestyle costs. As these costs increase, the need for budgeting becomes more essential and beneficial. During these moments, college students may prioritize allocating their money towards saving for their tuition costs and textbook fees, rather than purchasing/investing in foods that properly nourish them. Therefore, it has become a common occurrence for students to purchase unhealthy food options for low costs of money.

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

The main purpose of our website is to introduce healthy and affordable meal options/recipes to college students. The key features that our site has to offer to its users are a platform that allows college students to search for recipes based on their budget. With our implementation of the search bar, college students will be able to look up recipes based on the ingredients they have in their refrigerator. The application will also make it accessible for college students to search recipes within their diet restrictions. The user will receive a full recipe with ingredients, nutrient information, and price. Once the user creates an account they will be able to create their own meal plan


## Expected Features List

- Home Page with recipes on display
- Login/Register
- Search Recipes by ingredients
- Navigation bar for food categories/diet

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

- Allrecipes.com
- Food.com
Our project stands out because although it’s a recipe book, it’s specifically for college students who don’t have the time to come up with their own nutritious and diverse meals. We also include a page that allows them to create their own meal plan according to the recipes.

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?

- How could our website be more unique?
- How can we implement more accessibility features in regards to our recipe display?
