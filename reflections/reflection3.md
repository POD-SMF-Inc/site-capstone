## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 One successful thing that occurred this week is that we managed to fix the issue that we were having with enabling user authentication. 
 We were able to successfully implement the drag and drop feature for the weekly calendar, more work is still needed but it's a good starting base. 
 We were also able to display the survey information on the profile page and allow the user to edit some of the fields.


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

A challenge that our group faced this week was implementing a favorites button in our website, where we were having issues with showcasing whether or not the user had added a specific recipe to their favorites.
Another challenge we are facing is successfully implementing a search function within the modal that is used in the drag and drop recipe card, there seems to be an issue with embedding the recipe id to the dragover element.


* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We managed to finish a majority of the tasks within our sprint plan, where we programmed the overall logic of the search page, profile page, etc. However, we haven’t implemented the full logic for the profile page and we have to fix the styling for it as well as the search page.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The resources provided for us in our past labs and assignments have been helpful in debugging as I can always reference code that works for a certain component and compare that  to the new code that is giving me trouble.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The features that I would consider at risk are the favorites page/button where our group has found it somewhat difficult to implement the logic for the favorites button.
The planner is at risk as of now the user can create recipes from scratch but is not able to obtain recipes from the API.
