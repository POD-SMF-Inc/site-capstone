## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

This week we were able to complete the functionality part of the login and register pages.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

One of the challenges that our group faced this week was that often we would encounter problems/errors while pushing and pulling code to and from github. Another challenge that we encountered this week was learning how to use and access data from the api that we are currently using. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

In our sprint plan for this week, we planned to complete the login and register pages and set up the server with all of the necessary endpoints. We were able to finish all of our tasks and even began working on the tasks for sprint 2. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The resources that were provided to us greatly prepared us in planning and executing our capstone project for this week. For instance we utilized figma to create our wireframes and a general structure for our web pages, therefore we were able to use the css within our wireframes to assist in structuring our project. Another resource that we used were the lab tutorial videos that assisted with using tokens and authentication.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We think that our search page is at risk because we were planning to have the user filter the recipes by price but the API link we are using doesn’t provide an endpoint for sorting recipes by price. We’re thinking of either saving the data from the API link into a json file so that we can access the price of the recipes and sort them ourselves or using a different API link.
