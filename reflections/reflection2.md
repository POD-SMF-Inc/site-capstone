## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

One successful thing that occurred this week was that our group managed to create the Search Page for our website, where users will be able to search up different recipes according to their preferences such as ingredients, diet, cuisine, etc. We were able to debug various bugs that kept occurring due to our API and bgs related to our components not displaying properly within their pages. We were able to have the user update their profile info from the backend.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some of the challenges that my group and I faced this week was working on the CSS for displaying the recipes. Another challenge that occurred was accessing the API where it was difficult to use the API to create a meal planner for our users. We also encountered a challenge with the authentication for our website because when a user registered and was automatically logged in, they couldn’t view the authorized user pages.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We did not finish all the tasks that were in our sprint plan for this week, where we would encounter different bugs/issues while programming the authentication for our website.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Our past labs and assignments have been a major help in developing certain components such as the login or register pages as we have implemented them in past labs, allowing us to go back to our repos and examine the step by step instructions. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

At the moment, the planner component of our project is at risk as there is minimal documentation on the API’s planner endpoint and we are struggling to find resources that work with React. If the planner remains at risk we need to evaluate how we can still create a planner component without the use of a calendar api or calendar layout.
