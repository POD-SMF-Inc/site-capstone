## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

A successful thing that occurred this week is that we managed to fix the favorites feature, since last week we were having difficulty implementing the overall functionality of the favorites button.
We also began styling our website in a way that’s more interactive for the users. 
We were able to fix small bugs that dealt with the planners and meal planners so it works more efficiently now for the user.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

A challenge that our group faced this week was deploying our website to heroku, we encountered several issues in the process. However, we managed to successfully deploy our website.
Another challenge we were faced with was allowing the user to upload a profile picture when they edit their profile. We’re using Cloudinary to store the images, but currently have a 404 error when attempting to upload the image. 


* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes, we managed to finish the search page and other features such as video tutorials and the favorites function. However, we haven’t been able to get the upload profile picture function to work properly yet. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, the resources that were given to us at the beginning of the program, assisted us with our project. This week in regards to our capstone sprint, we used the resource that guided us through successfully deploying our react app.


* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Currently, we are still on track and have completed our core features and most important user stories, so there aren’t any features at risk. For the last sprint we plan on focusing on styling and adding stretch features if we have time.
