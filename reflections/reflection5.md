## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 

The pacing of the capstone project was just right, we believe that we had enough time to implement the core features of our website.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

Over time our plan for the website changed because we assumed that we would be able to implement specific features; however, when the time came to work on those features we weren’t able to implement them. This occurred due to our lack of understanding of the API that we were using to receive our data. If we were to start over on this project we would dedicate more time towards understanding the API and how to use it.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?

The labs and weekly assignments prepared us by providing us with the basic skills we needed to develop the backend and frontend of our website. With our knowledge of routes/models and the postgres database, we were able to successfully set up the api for our website. Learning react js helped us develop the user interface for our website. We would like to have learned more about creating a mobile responsive website. 


* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

Our mentors helped us throughout the whole process of planning our capstone project and gave us feedback when we needed it. The TA’s and instructors were also a great resource as they have been with us throughout the labs and assignments, making it easier to get help and be understanding of our skills.
The bug bash was also helpful because it revealed bugs we weren’t aware our website had.
